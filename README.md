MyBlog


This is a web application, a blog, written in Java.

I tried to implement these design patterns:

  MVC:
      Servlets serving as controller for different urls and
      .jsp files serving as view.

  For data accesing i tried to implement the DAO pattern. In this case 
  i used 2 classes PostBean and ClientBean as data manager(getting rows
  from database and returning java objects (Post and Client) ). This way
  the app logic is separated from queries.



  Database connection is generated by a singleton. Each time, there is generated
  a new connection, so multithreading is allowed.

This app contain a full sing up, sign in and sign out function.

This app uses  an already set up database, in my case Derby.

I used NetBeans IDE to write this app under Windows.
